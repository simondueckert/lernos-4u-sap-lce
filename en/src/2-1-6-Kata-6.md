### Inbox Zero in 4 Steps (Kata)

In this kata, you'll apply steps 2 and 3 of Getting Things Done to empty your inbox(es) and transfer everything to your organizational system. After that, you can be sure you haven't forgotten anything. Only then can you fully concentrate on the tasks at hand.



**Step 1:**

Open your inbox and work in a focused way through all the elements, such as emails, appointment acceptances, tweets, likes, feedback, callbacks, etc.). Ask yourself the question "What is it?" about each item.



**Step 2:**

Now ask yourself if you need to do something about the selected element or not.



**Step 3:**

If you don't need to do anything about the selected item, you have the following options:

- Delete it, if you don't need it in the future.
- Store in reference material if you need to access it quickly in the future
- File in Someday/Maybe, if you want to revisit the item at a later date.



**Step 4:**

If you need to do something about the selected item, here are the options:

- 2-minute rule: if it takes less than 2 minutes to do, do it right away, if not:
- Delegate: check if you need to do the activity yourself or can delegate it to someone else, if not:
- Add activity to the Next Steps list if it needs to be done at the next possible time, or
- add the activity to the calendar, if it should be done at a certain time or
