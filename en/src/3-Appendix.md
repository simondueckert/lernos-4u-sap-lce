## Circle Facilitation Checklist

When learning in the Circle, the Circle facilitation checklist helps facilitators organize the Circle in a structured way. You can decide in week 0 if one person will coordinate the whole sprint or if you want to rotate the role. It is best to copy the checklist to a place where all Circle members have access to it (e.g. OneNote, Etherpad, OneDrive, Dropbox).

**Week 0 - Sprint Planning & Get Together**

If you don't know each other in the Circle yet, get to know each other in Week 0.
Plan when you will meet, what tools you will use and
and who the moderator will be.

* **Check-in:** Welcome! *(5 minutes)*
* **Get together:** Who are you? Introduce yourself. Five-minute timebox
  per Circle member. *(25 minutes)*
* **Sprint planning** see below *(25 minutes)*.
* **Check-out:** Confirm next meeting. *(5 minutes)*

Define a Circle facilitator to handle event and time management. One of the biggest obstacles to successful Circle is discipline and time management. The facilitator is not the "boss" of the Circle, but a regular Circle member who makes sure things run smoothly. Determine what learning path you will use. Define the day and time of the weekly meeting. Define whether you will meet in person or virtually. Define the tools you will use for communication and documentation in the Circle. Decide which of the suggested exercises you will do in the Circle. Also decide if you want to use the lernOS Canvas (see chapter lernOS Canvas) as a supporting tool.

* **Circle Moderator:** Fixed / Rotating.
* **Day and time of Weekly:** ...
* **Weekly meetings are:** In person / Virtual.
* **Flipped Classroom Approach:** Yes / No.
* **Tools used (can everyone use them?):** ...
* **Do we use Canvas:** Yes / No.

**ProTip:** everyone should do the "Past Forward" and "Thinking Visually with the lernOS Canvas" katas in week 0 to find the right goals for the lernOS Sprint.

**ProTip:** in many cases the time to do the exercises in the Weekly is too short. Therefore use the method [Flipped
Classroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom): each Circle member prepares the exercises as "homework", so you have more time in the Weekly to discuss the results.

**ProTip:** if you want to document your Circle in OneNote or use Microsoft Teams for the Circle, have a look at the [lernOS Circle Template](https://github.com/cogneon/lernos-core/tree/master/lernOS%20Circle%20Template) (available only in German). In it you will find a template for documentation in the Circle.

**ProTip:** If you use the lernOS OneNote Circle Template, you can take a recent photo of your Canvas and
paste it so the other Circle members can see it and give feedback.
