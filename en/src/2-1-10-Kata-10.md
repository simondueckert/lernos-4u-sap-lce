### Do A Daily Review (Kata)

Often a weekly review is not enough to be able to react quickly enough to all new developments. In this Kata you will learn what a Daily Review is and decide if and when you want to do such dailies with yourself.

**Step 1:**

Consider for yourself if your daily life is so fast-paced that a Weekly is not enough for you to organize and you would like to do an additional Daily Review. If so, think about how long and when the Daily could be. A Daily does not have to be at the same time every day.

**ProTip:** if you use the 60-20-20 minute rule of time management (schedule 60% of the day, 20% for social activities, 20% for contingencies), you will always have enough time for a Daily.

**Step 2:**

Complete the following steps for your Daily Review:

- **Calendar:** check if all tasks are done for the day's appointments.
- **Emergency scan:** check if any new items have been added to your inboxes that you need to take care of immediately
- **Check lists:** check your next steps list and project lists to see if anything needs to be done today
- **Inbox zero:** if you have time, work through the items in your inboxes. This will save you a lot of time later in the Weekly.
