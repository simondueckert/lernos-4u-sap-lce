### Top 10 Sources on GTD (Kata)

The basics of GTD are documented in many places on the internet & in the literature. In this kata, familiarize yourself with the basics of GTD and create an environment that puts you in an optimal situation. This environment is based on the three pillars of time, place and tools.



**Step 1:**

Below I have compiled some resources that you can use to familiarize yourself with the method. Pick at least three materials from the following list and learn the basics of GTD:

1. Talk [Getting in control and creating space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOSFxKaqOm4) by David Allen at TEDx Amsterdam.
2. Understanding the GTD best practices - chapter in one of David Allen's GTD setup guides (e.g., [Getting Things Done Setup Guide for Microsoft To Do](https://gettingthingsdone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GTD_Microsoft_To_Do_LTR_sample.pdf)
3. Website [gettingthingsdone.com](https://gettingthingsdone.com/) - official website of David Allen with many materials in the [blog and podcast](https://gettingthingsdone.com/resources/)
4. Wikipedia article [Getting Things Done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done)
5th article [Getting Things Done: The Science behind Stress-Free Productivity](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/GTD-cognition.pdf)
6. Subreddit [Getting Things Done](https://www.reddit.com/r/gtd/) on reddit
6. 8th Video [GTD - Animated Book Summary And Review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCswMsONkwY) on YouTube.
9. playlist [GTD with Rosa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMSXDIo2daE&list=PLVKNjykg9ryZH-QvGVBIaSTq25ynoh1Qu) on YouTube
10. podcast episode [David Allen - The Art of Getting Things Done](https://www.podchaser.com/podcasts/the-tim-ferriss-show-87589/episodes/384-david-allen-the-art-of-get-44321188) on the Tim Ferris Show

Make sure you have internalized the [Five Steps of Getting Things Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com/what-is-gtd/):

- **STEP 1 GATHER - Gather everything that has your attention**.
  Write, draw or collect everything that catches your attention in a tool or on paper.
- **STEP 2 CLARIFY - Process what it means**.
  Is it actionable? If so, decide on the next action and project (if more than one action is needed). If not, decide if it is trash, reference, or something to put on hold.
- **STEP 3 ORGANIZE - Put it where it belongs**.
  Create reminders about the content in appropriate places.
- **STEP 4 REFLECT - Review Frequently**.
  Update and review all relevant system content to regain control and focus.
- **STEP 5 ACTIVATE - Just Do**.
  Use your trusted system to make action decisions with confidence and clarity.

**Step 2:**

Decide how you want to use your GTD system:

1. professional
2. private
3. professional and private



**Step 3:**

Consider which of the artifacts of GTD you already use today and document them. In case of professional and private use, the documentation has to be done twice.  

| Artifact | Professional | Private |
| --------------------- | --------- | ------ |
| Inbox(es) | |
| Calendar | |
| Next Steps | |
| Wait for | |
| reference file | |
| Someday/maybe | |
| projects | |
| Project Site | |



**Step 4:**

Gather the working tools you want to use in your GTD system. To do this, look at the list of *The Basic Processing Tools* in the [Accompanying Material to the GTD Audiobook](https://gettingthingsdone.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PDF_1st_edition_GTD_audiobook.pdf) and write down what other material you need.
