# Preface

*Note: This is the [SAP Learning Circle Edition](https://events.sap.com/de/learning-circle-experience/de/home) of the lernOS for You guide. Unlike the full [lernOS for You Guide](https://cogneon.github.io/lernos-for-you/en/), this contains only the Productivity and Stress-Free (GTD) learning path.*.

What is the **learnOS for You Guide** good for? We are facing enormous challenges driven by globalization, digitalization, and rapid technological and scientific development. At the same time, these changes offer us many new opportunities for development. The future is uncertain and we cannot predict it.

So we need to be open and ready for it and shape it together (Source: [Learning Framework 2030](https://www.oecd.org/education/2030)). To navigate through the so-called [VUCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility,_uncertainty,_complexity_and_ambiguity) world of the 21st century, full of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity, teens, students, professionals, managers, and leaders must constantly evolve. Everyone needs to learn skills such as creativity, critical thinking, communication, and collaboration. Digital literacy is the competence to read, write, and participate in collaborative activities using digital tools. It is important to be able to use digital tools productively.

The motivation for personal development should be more than getting a well-paying job or making a profit. Everyone should care about their own well-being, but also the well-being of their friends and family, their communities and society. We need to learn what knowledge, skills, mindsets, attitudes, values, methods and tools we need to create a better future together.

lernOS can help you to get fit for the 21st century. lernOS helps you to organize your activities
and to learn consciously from every action. It also encourages networking with other people so you don't have to reinvent every wheel and repeat every mistake.

Best of all, lernOS is free, open and easy to understand. Start using it today, get familiar with the basics, and go through a learning path on your own, in a learning tandem, or in a Circle!

# About lernOS

**lernOS** is an [open system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_system_(systems_theory)) for [lifelong learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifelong_learning) and [learning organizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_organization). How lernOS works is described in **guidance** available in [open](https://opendefinition.org/). lernOS can easily be practiced as **individual**, in **team** or in the whole **organization**.

If you are completely new to lernOS, we recommend starting together in a **Circle** (4-5 people) or at least in a **learning tandem** (2 people). A checklist for facilitating Circlen/Tandems can be found in the appendix. You can find more information on the page [lernos.org](http://lernos.org). You can easily find fellow participants in the [lernOS Community CONNECT](https://community.cogneon.de). There is also the [lernOS Circlefinder](https://community.cogneon.de/c/lernos/lernos-circlefinder/) as a market place for Circle offers and requests.

**KEEP CALM & LEARN ON!**
