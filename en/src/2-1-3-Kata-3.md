### Set Up Your GTD Environment (Kata)

In this kata, you will set up a first version of your GTD environment. The environment is not static, but constantly adapts to your needs or new opportunities. 



**Step 1:**

Use the table to determine which tools and utilities you want to use for individual artifacts (visible results of your system). Document these e.g. in your lernOS Memex.

| Artifact | Tool or Aid |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Calendar ||
| Next Steps ||
| Wait for ||
| reference file ||
| Someday/Maybe | |
| projects ||
| project plans | |



**Step 2:**

Use the following checklist to complete the table:

* Do you have different physical and digital calendars?
* What task management tools do you use? What lists do you keep there? Are there other tools you use with colleagues or in your team?
* Where do you organize and document your projects?
* Have you thought about all reference repositories (files, contacts, wiki, links, literature)?
* What (digital) notebooks do you have? Do you use one of them as memex or 2nd brain?



**Step 3:**

Set up your GTD environment according to the previous considerations. Make sure that all information is accessible to you as barrier-free as possible at any place and at any time.
