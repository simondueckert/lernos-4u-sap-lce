As individuals, we can succeed in this society through learning and contribute to the well-being of all. Lifelong learning Learning is the intentional or incidental acquisition of knowledge or skills. This learning process leads to relatively stable changes in behavior, thinking, or feeling as a result of experience or new knowledge. With the Delors Report , a vision of lifelong learning (\"learning throughout life\") was published by the European Commission in 1996. The report identifies the four pillars of lifelong learning that should be integrated into education and training: Learning to know - a broad general knowledge with the possibility to deepen a small number of topics. Learning to do - to acquire not only professional skills, but also the competence to deal with many situations and to work in teams. Learning to be - to develop one's own personality and be able to act with growing autonomy, judgment and personal responsibility. Learning to live together - by developing an understanding of other people and an appreciation of interdependence. But there are also very practical reasons that make lifelong learning necessary for you. As you can see from the half-life of knowledge graph, some types of knowledge quickly become outdated and require constant learning. While areas such as school knowledge remain reasonably stable, the need for new learning is particularly great in the technology and IT areas. For the citizens of a society, this means that they should continue to learn even after they have completed their education through school and university, in order not to lose touch. This learning process from birth to death is called lifelong or lifelong learning . Until the first education, parents and the state take care of learning in most cases, after that you have to practice self-organization . Knowledge Work In his book Landmarks of Tomorrow, Peter Drucker points to a change in the world of work toward knowledge-intensive work tasks, or knowledge work , as early as the late 1950s. The knowledge worker is characterized by the fact that he knows better about the work task and the necessary knowledge than the managers of the organization and therefore has to organize himself to a large extent. In contrast to Scientific Management , where there is a separation between headwork and manual work, both come together in the knowledge worker. The organizational sociologist Hellmut Willke defines knowledge work as activities (communications, transactions, interactions) that are characterized by the fact that the required knowledge is not acquired once in a lifetime through experience, initiation, teaching, specialized training or professionalization and then applied. Rather, knowledge work in the sense meant here requires that the relevant knowledge be continuously revised permanently regarded as capable of improvement is principally not regarded as truth but as a resource, and is inseparably coupled with non-knowledge, so that specific risks are associated with knowledge work. The german study Activities and Occupational Requirements in Knowledge-Intensive Occupations identified the following activities as particularly knowledge-intensive: Researching Developing Researching Documenting training Teaching Organizing other people' work processes (yes, managers and executives are also knowledge workers :-) If your daily work consists to a large extent of one or more of these activities, you can count yourself among the knowledge workers and you belong to the core target group of this guide. Productivity of Knowledge Work Productivity is classically defined as the ratio of products produced to the factors of production required to produce them. Peter Drucker, in the book Management Challenges for the 21st Century, summarizes knowledge worker productivity in six factors: knowledge worker productivity damands that we ask the question: What is the task? It demands that we impose the responsibility for their productivity on the individual knowledge workers themselfs. Knowledge workers have to manage themselves. They have to have autonomy. Continuous innovation has to be part of the work, the task, and the responsibility of knowledge workers. Knowledge work requires continuous learning on the part of the knowledge worker, but equally continuous teaching . Productivity of the knowledge worker is primarily not a matter of quantity of results. Quality is at least as important. Finally, knowledge worker productivity requires that the knowledge worker is both seen and treated as an \"asset\" rather than \"costs.\" It requires that knowledge workers want to work for the organization in preference to all other opportunities. The importance of autonomy, continuous learning (mastery), and independently figuring out the relevant work tasks (purpose) for work in the 21st century is also pointed out by Dan Pink in the well-received TED talk On the Surprising Science of Motivation .","title":"Knowledge Work and Lifelong Learning"},{"location":"1-1-Lifelong-Learning-and-Knowledge-Work/#lifelong-learning-and-knowledge-work","text":"We are currently in a very dynamic transition from an industrial to a knowledge society , which is characterized by rules and norms being continuously challenged through learning processes.

The lernOS Canvas uses the same basic structure, but the naming of the areas has been adapted to cover the relevant topics of the lernOS workflow on an individual level. Before getting into lernOS, you should have completed the Canvas once to get an overview of your current state. ProTip: To be able to work flexibly with the Canvas, you should never write directly on it. That's what sticky notes were invented for! In the upper part of the Canvas you can write your name and the date of creation or last modification. If you want to work with the Canvas electronically, you can copy it to OneNote or a digital whiteboard, for example. To fill out the Canvas for the first time, you can ask yourself the following questions, for example: Purpose: What are you living for? What do you want to accomplish in your life? Objectives & Key Results: What are your goals for the next 12 weeks? What are the measurable outcomes of those goals? My Roles: What are your current roles? What are the resulting goals? My Tasks: What are your current tasks? What are the goals that result from them? My Projects: What are your current projects? What are the goals that result from them? My Social Networks: What internal and external social networks (digital and analog) help you network? My Learning and Working Environment: What does your learning and working environment look like (infrastructure, content, tools, methods, etc.)? My Knowledge and Skills: What knowledge and skills are important to your goals, roles, tasks, and projects? What do you still need to learn?

In flow, there is a good balance between the demands of the activity and one's own abilities, so that there is neither overload nor underload. In order to enable concentration and focus in our fast and complex world of life and work, a good self-organization system is needed. The lernOS Flow therefore relies on 13-week cycles, which are called lernOS Sprints in reference to Scrum . Each sprint begins with planning and goal setting (week 0) and ends with a retrospective (week 12). The four quarters of a year are a good rhythm, but you can adjust this to your preference. The lernOS Flow is a workflow that knowledge workers and lifelong learners can use for their self-organization. For this purpose, practice-proven methods and approaches are used: Objectives & Key Results (OKR) for goal-oriented and focused work and learning by defining learning objectives and desired outcomes (see also OKR at Google). Hint: not included in this version of the guide. Getting Things Done (GTD) for productive and stress-free working and learning by structuring self-organization through a 5-step process (see also GTD by David Allen). Working Out Loud (WOL) for openly sharing work results across the network and telling backstories (see also WOL Definition by Bryce Williams, WOL Circle Guides by John Stepper).

If so, think about how long and when the Daily could be. A Daily does not have to be at the same time every day.

Step 2: Complete the following steps for your Daily Review: Calendar: check if all tasks are done for the day's appointments. Emergency scan: check if any new items have been added to your inboxes that you need to take care of immediately Check lists: check your next steps list and project lists to see if anything needs to be done today Inbox zero: if you have time, work through the items in your inboxes.

However, with the 6 Focus Horizons, there is also a structured approach to planning larger periods of time up to the meaning of life. In this kata, you will learn about the 6 focus horizons and schedule necessary appointments for them. The 6 focus horizons should be thought through at least once a quarter, half year or year (Quarterly, Yearly). Step 1: Familiarize yourself with the 6 focus horizons (Source: The Altitude Map by David Allen): HORIZONT 0/GROUND - Calendar/Actions: The next physical, visible actions to be taken for a project or other deliverable; each individual action to be taken for anything. HORIZONT 1 - Projects: Outcomes we want to achieve that require more than one action and can be completed within a year. HORIZONT 2 - Areas of Responsibility: Key areas of work and life that need to be maintained on standards to \"keep the engines running.\" HORIZONT 3 - Goals and Objectives: What specifically do we want and need to accomplish within the next 12 to 24 months to achieve the vision? HORIZONT 4 - Vision: How it will look, sound, feel when successfully implemented. Long-term results and ideal scenarios. HORIZONT 5 - Purpose and Principles: The ultimate intent for something and the benchmarks for its success. Why do we do it? What are the critical behaviors? Use the Getting Things Done book or one of the following sources for this: Blog The 6 Horizons of Focus by David Allen Article The Altitude Map by David Allen GTD Workflow Map by David Allen Step 2: Think about how often and on which date you want to deal with the horizons 2-5 (at least 1x per year). And put the dates in your calendar as a recurring appointment. Step 3: Using the sources above, think about the questions you want to ask in your Quarterly or Yearly and how you want to document the results. Create a checklist for Quarterly/Yearly (e.g., with the other checklists in your lernOS Memex). ProTip: the Past Forward format from Week 0 is great for developing an idea for your vision.

Examples: social: content can be made available to others; mobile: content is available on mobile devices; analytics: frequently used content is displayed preferentially; cloud: content is stored (securely) in the cloud for convenient access from multiple devices. Step 2: Think about which content topics should be mapped in your reference repository. These will form the entry points (navigation) into your reference file. Some examples of typical topics: Administration Work resources Activities/Tasks Images Contacts Bookmarks/Favorites music Network Organizations Passwords Projects Strategy Events videos Knowledge areas/topics Step 3: Use the results from the previous steps to create your reference repository or adapt the existing structure. Test the repository in the coming weeks and continuously improve structure and functionality. ProTip: document your reference filing on a page in your lernOS Memex.

You can decide in week 0 if one person will coordinate the whole sprint or if you want to rotate the role. It is best to copy the checklist to a place where all Circle members have access to it (e.g. OneNote, Etherpad, OneDrive, Dropbox). Week 0 - Sprint Planning & Get Together If you don't know each other in the Circle yet, get to know each other in Week 0. Plan when you will meet, what tools you will use and and who the moderator will be. Check-in: Welcome! (5 minutes) Get together: Who are you? Introduce yourself. Five-minute timebox per Circle member. (25 minutes) Sprint planning see below (25 minutes) . Check-out: Confirm next meeting. (5 minutes) Define a Circle facilitator to handle event and time management. One of the biggest obstacles to successful Circle is discipline and time management. The facilitator is not the \"boss\" of the Circle, but a regular Circle member who makes sure things run smoothly. Determine what learning path you will use. Define the day and time of the weekly meeting. Define whether you will meet in person or virtually. Define the tools you will use for communication and documentation in the Circle. Decide which of the suggested exercises you will do in the Circle. Also decide if you want to use the lernOS Canvas (see chapter lernOS Canvas) as a supporting tool. Circle Moderator: Fixed / Rotating. Day and time of Weekly: ... Weekly meetings are: In person / Virtual. Flipped Classroom Approach: Yes / No. Tools used (can everyone use them?): ... Do we use Canvas: Yes / No. ProTip: everyone should do the \"Past Forward\" and \"Thinking Visually with the lernOS Canvas\" katas in week 0 to find the right goals for the lernOS Sprint. ProTip: in many cases the time to do the exercises in the Weekly is too short. Therefore use the method Flipped Classroom : each Circle member prepares the exercises as \"homework\", so you have more time in the Weekly to discuss the results. ProTip: if you want to document your Circle in OneNote or use Microsoft Teams for the Circle, have a look at the lernOS Circle Template (available only in German). In it you will find a template for documentation in the Circle. ProTip: If you use the lernOS OneNote Circle Template, you can take a recent photo of your Canvas and paste it so the other Circle members can see it and give feedback.
